# Notification System

The Work object is now capable of sending Slack notifications to both users and
channels. The notifications can be triggered in two ways: the completion of a Work
object, or a Work submitted to the 'notify' pipeline. In both cases the Work must have a
valid notify configuration.

## Overview of notify configuration

```
Work['notify'] = {
  'slack': {
    'channel_id': None,  # Valid Slack config must have a channel_id,
    'member_ids': None,  # or at least one member_ids set.
    'message': None,  # A written message to be displayed.
    'results': None,  # Boolean to display results or omit them.
    'products': None,  # Boolean to display list of products or omit them.
    'plots': None, Â # Boolean to display list of plots or omit them.
    'blocks': None,  # Customise message using Slack Blocks.
    'reply': None,  # Sending status of message.
  },
}
```

## Usage

### Define a `Work`

First define a simple `Work` object with the basic required fields populated.

```python
from chime_frb_api.workflow import Work

# Note: When using the notify pipeline, the 'site' must be 'chime'.
work = Work(pipeline="notify", user="tester", site="chime")
```

### Configuration for Slack

Below is an example configuration for sending a Slack message to both a channel and a
member.

```python
# If both the channel_id and member_ids are defined the message will go to both. However,
# at least one of these MUST be defined.
work.notify.slack.channel_id = "A1B2XY9Z"  # Not real
work.notify.slack.member_ids = ["BD31SV4S"]  # Not real

# Tip: If you want to use emojis you can draft your message in Slack then copy/paste it.
work.notify.slack.message = (
    "Hello :wave:, this is a message from the Workflow Slack bot."
)

# products, plots, and results all behave the same, so here we'll only define one, but
# all of them can be used simulataneously.
work.notify.slack.products = True
# Since the products is currently None lets define that.
work.products = ["test_file.dat"]
```

The configuration for `work.notify.slack.blocks` can be quite involved since it uses
Slack's Block Kit. For more info on Block Kit, please visit
<https://api.slack.com/block-kit>. An interactive Block Kit builder is also available to
help you use it without having to learn <https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/>.
